# Passive tag

## Summary
The passive tag indicates all the checks that are not active checks. <br>
We speak of an "active check" when the tester actively exploits software vulnerabilities.
When the tester just observes and monitors the software, in the way that they can not be distinguished from normal users, we speak of "passive checking".
