# Shodan

## What is Shodan?

Shodan is a search engine that crawls the entirety of the internet in search for connected devices.
Similar to Google, but instead of searching for websites, it searches for Internet connected devices.
These devices can range from routers and servers to Internet of Things devices to complex systems of certain industries.


## How does Shodan work?

Shodan works by requesting connections to every conceivable ip address on the Internet and indexing the information it gets back from those connection requests.


## What we check with Shodan

* Database <br>
In many cases, databases should not be available from the outside of your infrastructure. Shodan issues a warning when it does find one. Databases are vulnerable to attacks and therefore should not be hanging openly on the outside.
* Open ports <br>
Open ports provide an additional weak link in the system. One should at all times avoid opening ports unnecessarily. This shodan check looks at certain critical ports that are known to run software that should definitely not be on the outside and gives a corresponding score.
* CVEs <br>
CVE, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a database of information about vulnerabilities in computer systems. Shodan will query the versions of all running software and hold them up against the CVE to see if there are any vulnerabilities in the software.


## How to score better on a Shodan check

In general, the rule is that you put as much as you can inside your private network. Anything that doesn't belong outside, you don't put on the outside.
Also regularly updating running software to patch against exploits and weaknesses is a best practice to protect yourself.
