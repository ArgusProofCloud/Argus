## What is a CVE?

CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a database of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and computer security flaws.
We can refer to these issues with their unique CVE number.
With those lists we can scan the publicly exposed software and their versions to see if there are any vulnerabilities present.


## What is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)?

The CVSS, commonly known as the CVE score, is one of several ways to measure the impact of vulnerabilities.
CVSS is an open set of standards used to assess a vulnerability and assign a severity along a scale of 0-10.<br>
Every new version has another way of scoring the vulnerabilities.
The current version of CVSS is v3.1, which scores as following:

| Severity    | Base Score  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| None        | 0           |
| Low         | 0.1-3.9     |
| Medium      | 4.0-6.9     |
| High	      | 7.0-8.9     |
| Critical    | 9.0-10.0    |


## How do I fix a CVE?

When confronted with a CVE vulnerability, the best approach would be to look up the vulnerability and read up about the specifics.
Most of the time, it is fixed by upgrading the software to a newer version, however it could require more steps.
