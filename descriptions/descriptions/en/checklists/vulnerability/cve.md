# CVE

## What is a CVE?
CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number.

## What is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)?
The CVSS is one of several ways to measure the impact of vulnerabilities, which is commonly known as the CVE score. The CVSS is an open set of standards used to assess a vulnerability and assign a severity along a scale of 0-10. The current version of CVSS is v3.1, which breaks down the scale is as follows:

| Severity | Base Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| None | 0 |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 |
| High	 | 7.0-8.9 |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 |

## How do I fix a CVE?
To fix this you need to upgrade to a newer version.
