> How Safe am I? Really?

HowSamI was a responsibility given to the students of "Security Project", a course at AP Hogeschool.  
The idea is to create a highly available, agile platform to execute checks that control a given domain.  
We realised this by using different microservices that can be easily deployed with ansible scripts and dockerfiles.  
A high selling point of our platform is the use of a Kubernetes cluster, which ensures the autoscaling of all services.  
This project is created with a security mindset, but can be used for other (non-security) purposes. The principle of "plug 'n play" is a definite here, just remove / add / replace the checks with your own scripts and you're good to go.
For more details about what lives in the environment, we refer you to our [wiki page](https://github.com/WatcherWhale/SecProA/wiki).
