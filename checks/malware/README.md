# Malware Check
The website malware scanner is a free online tool that can be used to scan any website for malicious code, hidden iframes, vulnerability exploits, infected files and other suspicious activities. After performing an in-depth investigation free website malware scanner reports external links, iFrames, referenced domains, infected files and blacklisting status.

# What is malware?
Malware is bad software, plain and simple. It’s code that was created for the purpose of doing something sinister to your computer. Most of the time, it infiltrates a person’s system without their knowledge.

There are many different types of malware, and here’s where it starts to get confusing. Types of malware were typically named not for what they do but how they attack the machine. This is because engineering nerds who were the first to encounter malware were more interested in the method of delivery instead of the end-goal—which is why one category of malware that “tricks” a system in order to invade it is called a Trojan horse and not, say, a data deleter.

Other types of malware include viruses, which infect legitimate files, backdoors, which can open programs and steal data from your computer, and rootkits, which can spy and collect passwords. One of the more dangerous forms of malware, aptly named ransomware, literally holds your files for ransom by encrypting them. If you pay up, you might get the decryption key to regain access to them. If you don’t, they’re unavailable forever.

Another form of malware that is perhaps a little less mal is called a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP). “Potentially Unwanted Programs is a euphemism,” says Scott Wilson, Technical Product Manager at Malwarebytes. “These are programs you actually agree to install, but the agreement is generally obtained in a sneaky manner, such as having a pre-checked box on one of the many installation pages you need to click through. Many people find these programs to be annoying—interfering with your search behavior or displaying advertising on your computer are common behaviors—so anti-malware products help you deal with and remove such programs.”

# Malware Scanner
Many programs scan for malware using a database of known malware definitions (also called signatures). These definitions tell what the malware does and how to recognize it. If the anti-malware program detects a file that matches the definition, it’ll flag it as potential malware. This is a good way to remove known threats, but it does require regular updates to make sure the program doesn’t miss out on newly developed malware.
