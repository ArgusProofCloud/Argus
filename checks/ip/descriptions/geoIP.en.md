## What is GeoIP?

GeoIP is the process of locating a computers geographic location based on an IP address.
When scanning websites with the GeoIP test, the location of the server where the website is hosted will become known.


## Why GeoIP?

The GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, states that all data collected on citizens must be either stored in the EU or within a jurisdiction that has similar levels of protection.
Executing this test will tell wether the owner of the website breaks this rule of the GDPR or not.


## How do I become compliant?

Migrate the server where your website and databases are hosted to a country in Europe. Most cloud providers offer a data center within Europe.
