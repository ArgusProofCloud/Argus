# Blacklist

## What is a blacklist?

A blacklist or blocklist is essentially a public list of email addresses, domains and IP addresses that are known as "spam".
The email adresses produce malicious or meaningless emails and the domains and IP adresses are known as malicious with a probability of damage upon visiting.
The purpose of such lists is to block those addresses beforehand so that manual filtering of these won't be necessary.


## What does it mean when I'm on a list?

When a website gets on one of these lists, users can no longer access the site directly and servers that use these blacklists will block emails from the domain.


## How do I get off a blacklist?

Being listed on a smaller list is not that much of a concern as for the most part, it won’t impact your ability to communicate with your customers too much. However, if you land onto one of the bigger lists, used by ISPs to filter spam, it can have quite an impact on your emails being delivered and thus, your business.

If you’re blacklisted and believe you shouldn’t be, you will have to take actions to have your IP removed. Most lists will have clear instructions on how to get your domain off their list. This is done through a process called delisting and is often done by directly contacting the operators of the list and requesting a removal.
