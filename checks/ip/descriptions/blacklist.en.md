## What is a Blacklist?

Depending on the source, the amount of daily spam emails being sent is anywhere between 80 to 95% of all emails sent on the internet that day. With such large numbers, most experts agree that manually sorting through your inbox to get rid of spam has become highly inefficient. As such, public blacklists of mail servers and IP addresses have been created to prevent repeat offenders from relaying spam.

A blacklist is a list of blocked domains, email addresses or IP addresses. When a website gets on one of these lists, users can no longer access the site directly and servers that use these blacklists will block emails from the domain.

## How do I get off a blacklist?

Being listed on a smaller list is not that much of a concern as for the most part, it won’t impact your ability to communicate with your customers too much. However, if you land onto one of the bigger lists, used by ISPs to filter spam, it can have quite an impact on your emails being delivered and thus, your business.

If you’re blacklisted and believe you shouldn’t be, you will have to take actions to have your IP removed from the said list. Most DNSBLs will have clear instructions on how to get your domain off their list. This is done through a process called delisting and is done by directly contacting the operators of the list and requesting a removal.
