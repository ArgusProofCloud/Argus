# Mailcheck - MX


## What is MX?

In the Mail eXchange record, MX record,  the owner of the domain is able to specify the mail server responsible for accepting emails for the whole domain name.
This includes how the email should be routed inside the domain.


## Why do I need a MX record?

MX records are a great way to organise your incoming mails and can also help to detect threats.
These threats, mostly spear phishing, are intercepted by using such a record.
MX makes it possible to recieve early warning signs that a domain is under attack.
There are also ways to integrate MX-record monitoring for a swifter way to detect malicious activity.
