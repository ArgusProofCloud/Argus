# Mailchecks - DMARC


## What is DMARC?

DMARC, Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance, is an email authentication protocol.
DMARC provides information on which authentication methods, SPF and/or DKIM are used for its domain and what to do when these methods fail (see descriptions of SPF and DKIM).
The policy can state that the receiver should quarantine/reject the message but it can also state to report back to the sender's domain.


## Why is DMARC important?

By using DMARC, the domain owners gain the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use, also known as "email spoofing".
Without a proper DMARC protocol, attackers can easily send phishing emails and email scams as if they came from your domain.
