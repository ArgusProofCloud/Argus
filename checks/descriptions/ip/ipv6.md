# IPV6

## Why is IPV6 important?

IPv6, the new version of the IP protocol, provides important new capabilities, including a larger address space, more flexible subnetting, simplified address assignment and improved security.

As IPv6 adoption grows, DNS is becoming more important as a mechanism to help users, using both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, reach the most appropriate IP address.
