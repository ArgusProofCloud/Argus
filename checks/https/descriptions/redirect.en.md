# Redirect

## HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that uses HTTP has HTTP:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has HTTPS://.

## Why is a redirect necessary?

To ensure that visitors to a website always use a secure connection, unsecured connections are automatically forwarded from HTTP to HTTPS.
