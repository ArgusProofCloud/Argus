# SSL/TLS Certificates

## Why do I need a SSL/TLS Certificate?

SSL/TLS Certificates provide both encryption and trust to the public internet.

### Encryption

SSL/TLS Certificates provide end-to-end-encryption with the TLS or the discontinued and
unsafe SSL protocol. In short this means that a server and an end-user can
communicate with eachother without anyone else knowing what they are
communicating to eachother.

In short a bad actor cannot understand any of the communication between your
servers and your clients.
